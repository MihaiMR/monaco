<h3 align="center">A Light Injector for your Roblox Scripts.</h3>

LInjector, is a free UI interface for Exploit Developers, minimal and easy to customize. <br>
Fluxus API should work with UWP Roblox (I'm not ensuring nothing). [Learn More about Hyperion Byfron](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FRWTMnPZ-6fuyKjaT_YDU8tT1DrmLSw63YKtc2CfiMI/edit?usp=sharing) <br>
If you have a working Dynamic-Link Library, you can edit source of LInjector. <br>
LInjector uses Monaco editor, that one that powers Visual Studio Code, with syntax highlighting, [developed by Supercomet Labs](https://cometrbx.xyz/).
Also aviable on [luau-monaco](https://github.com/ItzzExcel/luau-monaco)

## How to build?
To edit the Forms, first compile, for any reason, forms can't load if not compiled. If you opened the forms before compile, restart Visual Studio and your problem should be fixed.
- Clone the repo `gh repo clone ItzzExcel/LInjector`
- Open LInjector.sln in Visual Studio 2022.
- Set Release x86
- Ctrl + Shift + B (build)

### Don't ask why the commits are hashes pls.

### Is LInjector key-less?
Yes, LInjector is key-less, free and open-source.

#### LInjector, including The LExploits Tools are not fully developed and can't be tested due to Hyperion Byfron, Roblox Anticheat.<br>
ðŸ”´ All Exploits, including LInjector are currently patched.<br>Use any executor at your own risk.<br>
Fluxus, Electron and Comet is working with UWP Roblox.</h4>
