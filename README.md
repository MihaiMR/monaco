<h3 align="center">LInjector | Open-source executor interface for Roblox.</h3>

<hr/>

LInjector, is a free UI interface for Exploit Developers, minimal and easy to customize. <br>
Fluxus API should work with UWP Roblox (I'm not ensuring nothing). [Learn More about Hyperion Byfron](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FRWTMnPZ-6fuyKjaT_YDU8tT1DrmLSw63YKtc2CfiMI/edit?usp=sharing) <br>
If you have a working Dynamic-Link Library (DLL), you can edit source of LInjector. <br>
LInjector uses Monaco editor, that one that powers Visual Studio Code, with syntax highlighting, [developed by Supercomet Labs](https://cometrbx.xyz/).
Also aviable on [luau-monaco](https://github.com/ItzzExcel/luau-monaco)
